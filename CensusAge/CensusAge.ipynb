    "\n",
    "* Without using any libraries, write a function `central_measures(clean_data)` that takes a list of `(age_year, number)` pairs, and returns a triple `(mean, median, mode)` containing the _measures of central tendency_ for age in years.\n",
    "  * Where the _mean_ falls between two integers, your function should round to the nearest year. Where it is exactly half way, it should choose the even year (following standard practice). For example, if the calculated mean is 51.5, the function would return 52.\n",
    "  * Where the _median_ falls between two age groups, it should return the higher age group. For example, if the population consisted only of 100 people aged 20, and 100 people aged 21, the function would return 21 (since the ages will be clustered around 21.0).\n",
    "  * If there is more than one _mode_, your function should return the lowest age mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should endeavour to make your function \"space efficient\". For example, rather than calculating the median by creating a (very long) list of all the people, think about using a count of people in each age group to find the median.\n",
