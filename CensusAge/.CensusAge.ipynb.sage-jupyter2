This is akin to the *Statistical Imputation* we discuss in the *Census* case study (where we discuss Hot Decking, Mean Substitution, Probabilistic and Regression methods).\n\nWe'll need to fill in the data for each year group. We'll start with a simple method, and move on to a more challenging one.\n\nAs a first approximation we will simply use an averaging approach. We'll make an *assumption* that the number of people in a date range is approximately the same for each year in that category (with excess people added \"from the left\").\n\n#### 2. Checked Solution [1 prac mark]\n\n* Write a function `spread(age_cat, num)` that:\n  * takes as arguments a date range string `age_cat` and a non-negative integer `num`\n    * where `age_cat` represents a date range in the format `Age_yr_`*n1_n2*, where *n1* <= *n2* are _any valid human ages_ (eg. `Age_yr_80_84`)\n  * returns a pair (2-tuple) of lists:\n    * the first list should contain strings in the form `Age_yr_`*n* where *n* ranges from the first to the last year in the range (eg. `Age_yr_80`, `Age_yr_81`,... in the above example)\n    * the second list contains a list of integers adding up to `num` such that:\n      * if `num` is divisible by the number of years in the range, then each integer should be the same (ie. the people are evenly spread)\n      * if there is a remainder from dividing `num` by the number of years, the remainder should be added one at a time to the year groups starting at the lowest age (80 in this example) until there are no more remaining\n\nFor example, `spread('Age_yr_80_84', 7)` should return:\n\n```\n(['Age_yr_80', 'Age_yr_81', 'Age_yr_82', 'Age_yr_83', 'Age_yr_84'], [2, 2, 1, 1, 1])\n```\n\nTip: You might find `divmod` useful. Also, recall that `+` and `*` can be used to create lists.\n\n> _Good Programming Tip_: When parsing strings (for example) it is better where possible (more robust, more readable, more maintainable) to use components that have some \"meaning\" to break down objects, rather than numerical indices.\n>\n> For example, in _DiversityInStudy_ most of the units were in the form `STAT2023-2`. To get the teaching period, we could use something like `unit[9]`. However, later in the file there were some non-standard semesters, such as `SVLG1225-Y3`, which would break this code.\n>\n> Instead we could use something like `(code,_,period) = unit.partition(\"-\")` which recognises the logical _role_ played by the dash - left of the dash means one thing, right of the dash another. \n>\n> This code will work equally well for  `SVLG1225-Y3` because it is based on the roles of the components, rather than their exact numerical position.\n\n","pos":11,"type":"cell"}

Checked Solution [1 prac mark]\n\nFor the last checked solution of this lab, you are given less \"scaffolding\" and it is up to you to decide how to best break down the problem.\n\n* Without using any libraries, write a function `central_measures(clean_data)` that takes a list of `(age_year, number)` pairs, and returns a triple `(mean, median, mode)` containing the _measures of central tendency_ for age in years.\n  * Where the _mean_ falls between two integers, your function should round to the nearest year. Where it is exactly half way, it should choose the even year (following standard practice). For example, if the calculated mean is 51.5, the function would return 52.\n  * Where the _median_ falls between two age groups, it should return the higher age group. For example, if the population consisted only of 100 people aged 20, and 100 people aged 21, the function would return 21 (since the ages will be clustered around 21.0).\n  * If there is more than one _mode_, your function should return the lowest age mode.\n\n* You should endeavour to make your function \"space efficient\". For example, rather than calculating the median by creating a (very long) list of all the people, think about using a count of people in each age group to find the median.\n\nTest your function thoroughly. Some example (unit) tests are included below. Do you agree with the answers given?\n","pos":21,"type":"cell"}
